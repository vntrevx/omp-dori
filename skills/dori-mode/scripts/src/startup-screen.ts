/**
 * Every phrase that means a lane failed to start, one row each (#202), in three kinds:
 * - `anywhere`: text no healthy screen prints (omo's own failure lines, provider messages). It matches even glued onto
 *   the end of a pane-wide line by the unwrapped read (`...okNo API key`).
 * - `word`: a phrase that names a failure, not a topic (`rate limit reached`, never bare `rate limit`, `quota` or a
 *   component such as `rate limiter`). It must stand alone; see `standsAlone`. Its gaps are single spaces as printed
 *   (the unwrapped read puts back a space hc cut at a wrap), never `-`, so a kebab-case lane key or brief file name
 *   such as `fix-rate-limit-error` is not one.
 * - `value`: an error code (`insufficient_quota`, `QUOTA_EXCEEDED`), counted only where it is a value: after `error`,
 *   `code`, `type` or `status` and a `:` or `=` (`"type":"rate_limit_error"`, `code=quotaExceeded`). The same code
 *   in source (`case 'rate_limit_error':`, `instanceof RateLimitError`, `X === 'RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED'`) is not.
 * test/startup-screen.test.ts holds the corpus: real provider and tool output with its source, rule cases, and code
 * and prose that must report nothing.
