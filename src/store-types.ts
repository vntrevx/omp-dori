 * One lane record. `sessionRef` is the session it runs in, on whichever runtime opened it; `paneId`/`tabId` are written
 * beside it (the ref's id and container) so an older binary still reads the file. `migratedFrom`: the sessions it ran in
 * before a `dori migrate`. `migration`: a handover is in progress, and the duty loop leaves the record alone.
 * `sessionPath`: the agent's own session file, when its command records one; `dori migrate --resume` needs it.
 * `progressAt`: the last time the lane made progress (start, a report with new evidence, READY); the duty loop nudges and
 * escalates on it, and a record from before it existed falls back to its last start, report or READY. `lastEvidence`:
 * the evidence that last moved it. `evidenceSeen`: links that already counted once. `evidenceMtimes`: each file that
 * counted, by absolute path, with the modification time it counted with. `escalatedAt`: when the lead was last told the
 * lane made no progress; one escalation per stall. `lastActivityAt`: the last sign of life (any report, a working pane).
 * `lostUntold`: marked lost while no lead was registered; the duty loop tells the lead once one is.
